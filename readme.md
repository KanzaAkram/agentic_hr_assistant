## How it Works: The Agents

The core of this application lies in its specialized agents, each handling a distinct part of the recruitment workflow:

### Job Description Agent (`agents/job_description_agent.py`)

*   **Purpose:** Handles all tasks related to job descriptions.
*   **Technology:** Uses Google Gemini (via `langchain_google_genai`) for natural language understanding and generation.
*   **Functions:**
    *   `generate_job_description()`: Creates a new JD based on role, industry, experience, skills, and company details.
    *   `refine_job_description()`: Modifies an existing JD based on user instructions and company context.
    *   `validate_job_description()`: Analyzes a JD for potential issues like bias, vagueness, and missing sections, offering suggestions.

### Resume Parser Agent (`agents/resume_parser_agent.py`)

*   **Purpose:** Extracts raw text and basic information from PDF resumes.
*   **Technology:** Uses `PyPDF2` for PDF text extraction and `re` (regular expressions) for simple pattern matching (email, phone).
*   **Functions:**
    *   `extract_text_from_pdf()`: Reads a PDF file object and returns its text content.
    *   `extract_email()`: Finds potential email addresses in the text.
    *   `extract_phone()`: Finds potential phone numbers in the text.
    *   `extract_name()`: Attempts to identify the candidate's name from the text or filename.
    *   *Note:* This agent focuses on extraction, not complex analysis.

### Candidate Analyzer Agent (`agents/candidate_analyzer_agent.py`)

*   **Purpose:** Analyzes the extracted resume text against the confirmed job description to evaluate candidate suitability.
*   **Technology:** Uses Google Gemini (via `langchain_google_genai`) for in-depth analysis and structured data generation (JSON).
*   **Functions:**
    *   `analyze_resume()`: Compares resume text to the JD, outputting a JSON containing name, email, skill/experience match percentages, overall score, key skills, strengths, weaknesses, and a hiring recommendation.
    *   `_make_automatic_decision()`: (Internal helper) Determines an initial status (Approved, Pending, Rejected) based on the analysis score and recommendation.
    *   `rank_candidates()`: Ranks a list of analyzed candidates based on weighted scores (customizable).
    *   `get_best_interview_time_slot()`: Recommends an available interview slot for a candidate using AI, considering their profile and availability.

### Communication Agent (`agents/communication_agent.py`)

*   **Purpose:** Manages automated communication with candidates.
*   **Technology:** Uses Google Gemini (via `langchain_google_genai`) for email content generation and Python's `smtplib` and `email` modules for sending emails via Gmail SMTP.
*   **Functions:**
    *   `generate_interview_email()`: Creates a personalized interview invitation email body and subject line based on candidate info, JD, and interview details.
    *   `generate_rejection_email()`: Creates a professional rejection email (optional feedback included).
    *   `send_email()`: Connects to Gmail using provided credentials (email and App Password) and sends the generated email. Requires SMTP configuration.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend/Logic:** Python 3.x
*   **Web Framework:** Streamlit
*   **AI/LLM:** Google Gemini (via `langchain-google-genai`)
*   **PDF Parsing:** PyPDF2
*   **Data Handling:** Pandas
*   **Email:** smtplib, email (Python Standard Libraries)
*   **Configuration:** (Optional but recommended) `python-dotenv`

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8 or higher
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   Git (for cloning the repository)
*   **Google Gemini API Key:** Obtain from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) or Google Cloud Console.
*   **Gmail Account:** For sending emails.
*   **Gmail App Password:** **Crucially, you need an App Password, not your regular Gmail password.** Generate one from your Google Account settings:
    1.  Go to your Google Account -> Security.
    2.  Ensure 2-Step Verification is ON.
    3.  Go to App passwords.
    4.  Select "Mail" for the app and "Other (Custom name)" for the device (e.g., "HR Assistant Pro").
    5.  Generate the password and copy the 16-character code. **Save this securely.**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # For Linux/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Create a `requirements.txt` file:**
    Based on the imports in your code, create a file named `requirements.txt` in the project root with the following content:

    ```txt
    streamlit
    pandas
    PyPDF2
    langchain-google-genai
    # Add any other specific dependencies if needed
    # Optional: python-dotenv (if using .env for keys)
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

You need to provide your API keys and email credentials to the application. You can do this directly via the Streamlit sidebar when the app runs, or for better security and management (especially if deploying), use environment variables.

**Option 1: Input via Sidebar (as coded)**

*   Run the application (`streamlit run main.py`).
*   Enter your Google Gemini API Key, Gmail Email Address, and the generated Gmail App Password in the sidebar fields.

**Option 2: Using Environment Variables (Recommended Practice)**

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory.
2.  Add your credentials to the `.env` file:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    GMAIL_EMAIL="your_email@gmail.com"
    GMAIL_PASSWORD="your_16_character_app_password"
    ```
3.  (Optional) Install `python-dotenv`: `pip install python-dotenv`
4.  Modify `main.py` (and potentially agent initializations) to load these variables at the start using `load_dotenv()` from the `dotenv` library. *Note: The current code reads directly from `st.text_input`, so you would need to adjust it to prioritize environment variables if they exist.*

## Running the Application

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Make sure you are in the project's root directory (where `main.py` is located).
3.  Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
4.  The application should open in your default web browser.

2.  Click **Browse files** under "Upload candidate resumes (PDF)" and select one or more PDF resume files.
3.  Click **Process Resumes**.
4.  The application will:
    *   Extract text from each PDF using the `ResumeParserAgent`.
    *   Analyze each resume against the confirmed JD using the `CandidateAnalyzerAgent`.
    *   Score each candidate (Skills Match %, Experience Match %, Overall Score).
    *   Provide key skills, strengths, weaknesses, and a recommendation.
    *   Apply an **Automated Decision** based on the score and the threshold set in the sidebar.
5.  **Automated Actions (if enabled):**
    *   If **Auto-generate & send interview emails** is checked and email credentials are valid, the system will automatically:
        *   Identify candidates whose status is "Approved".
        *   Use the `CandidateAnalyzerAgent` to pick the best available interview slot.
        *   Use the `CommunicationAgent` to generate a personalized interview email.
        *   Send the email via Gmail.
        *   Mark the interview slot as unavailable.
        *   Update the candidate's "Email Sent" status.
6.  **Review Results:**
    *   The candidate analysis results appear in an editable table.
    *   Use the **filters** (Minimum Score, Recommendation, Status) to narrow down the list.
    *   You can **manually change the Status** of any candidate directly in the table (e.g., change "Pending" to "Approved" or "Rejected"). *Note: Manually approving might trigger email sending if auto-email is enabled for newly approved candidates (check the specific logic implemented around the "Send Interview Invitations" button).*
